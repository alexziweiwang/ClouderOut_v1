Card Game:
uses card(s) to "attack" the opponent

- opponent can be 1 (dual) or more (multiplayer)
- attacked target(to one opponent) can be one(card holder) or more(each card's character)
- winning rules can be different: 1) loses when hp becomes 0; 2) wins when all cards out of hand; 3) loses when all cards out of hand
- card strength: 1) linear ranking, pure numeric value for each card; 2) circular comparison, only loses when meets the upper card; 3) circular comparison, only wins when meets lower card
- card properties: each card can have several properties (for example, value + type, or more)
- combination of card, custom: use relationship logic (and, or, not, >, >=, ==, <=, <) to decide the winning one
 (TODO: mini task: make a game-rule mini app for users with no coding experience to organize their custom game rules)
- custom skills, buffs, tools: adding effects to any action of the associated card/player
- card fighting format: once together, or by player's choice of fighting sequence
- card in/out rules: if players would need to receive cards each round, or they use all cards on hand, or if they transfer cards to others, etc.
