Shopping Item : "products"

for game-creators, 
products can only be created or hidden(off-stock)? 
in-case any player bought but can't find it if deleted by game-creator...


in nav-setter, should provide emu-product to show the UI;


for actual product management, consider a separate component;
    level should be similar to the player-account's security level and player-profile's changing frequency

for data management aspect, make sure not allowing players' changing
(consideration along with auth for accounts)
one-way changing by code only
