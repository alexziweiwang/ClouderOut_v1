This document is about idea and plans for game-data management.
Game-data in this project is defined as the data pool that will be used to make decision on game flow, such as the player's previous choice, player's hp, players friendship value with game characters, etc.
The game-data pool are fixed after the game-author finish the game, and all the actions during a player's playing would only change the game-data values.
That is, the tool to manage game-data is only available for game-authors, and the place, amount, and behaviour of game-data is only decided by game author. (game-author can be one or multiple people in future collborative mode, but overall this is a group of permission on the project.)

*** Relationship with tool elements:
1. inside a game-node:
each player action might update game-data
each node should have reference/access to update the game-data
the tool should allow the game-author to choose, update on a certain spot

2. between game nodes:
check some values in game data, for conditional node-enter
(game-data decides game flow here)

3. between chapters:
game data should be consistent all along the game experience. 
the author can have the option of maintaining separate chapter-specific data, as long as they use separate variables; overall, this is flexible based on their use.

*** Tool option design:
1) variable name
2) variable type (numeric-integer, numeric-float, boolean, ...)
3) default value
these are stored in an array of objects, and during game development, the author can choose by variable name and decide the behaviour.
