each "screen/piece" can be a conversational screen (optional for sequence/game node)

each "sequence"/small level/game-node: can contain 1 or more "pieces/screens" or a tyle of game-round [game-node is with LinkedList pointers for flexible orders]

each "chapter"(large level) is linked by linear order (consists of game-nodes)


** a game-node can be among the following game types: card, board, fort defense, fort offense, conversational text display

*** game node aspects:
for game-round:
1.game rule
2.element setting
3.looking setting
(for example, for board games, setup positions of "movable spots", "paths", and each "token")
(the author can provide a picture as background board for the board game, and add visible or invisible "movable spots";
they also need to specify the rules of moving.
TODO: think of modularized way of setting up game rules.
)
(TODO: later, provide animation options, for moving and visual effects)
