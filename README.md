# ClouderOut_v1

## Plan & intro of ClouderOut: a cloud-based lightweight game engine for 2d games
- base technology: React
- idea: provide users with simple UI to create, adjust and deploy the end-result React projects (as games)
- topics: 2d games: card game, board game, fort defense/offense game, text adventure game, etc.
- creator/author being the core user of this cloud platform

### Features (Perspective):
- account systems for creators and players
- lightweight computer requirement for creators (because main functionalities are done through on the web tool)
- for users of no coding-experience, provide logic organizer for complex game rules

### TODO list:
- [ ] base app: game engine part without topic: UI, menu, etc.
- [ ] design of each module (for types of various 2d games)
- [ ] testing plans
- [x] architecture design, user flow
- [ ] solution plans for concerns
- [x] hosting and launching options, plan
- [ ] hosting and launching options, implementation
- [ ] game product: resource management solution (carefully handle re-renders)
- [ ] abstraction of game logic: into modularizable organizer
- [ ] game mode analysis
- [ ] sample small projects (for test and demo)
- [ ] logic organizer for game rule (this can be a module to be used): between nodes & inside one game-round for specific game rules
- [ ] game data sharing and update design
