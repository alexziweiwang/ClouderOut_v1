# ClouderOut_v1

## Plan & intro of ClouderOut: a cloud-based lightweight game engine for 2d games
- base technology: React
- idea: provide users with simple UI to create, adjust and deploy the end-result React projects (as games)
- topics: 2d games: card game, board game, fort defense/offense game, text adventure game, etc.
- creator/author being the core user of this cloud platform

### Features (Perspective):
- account systems for creators and players
- lightweight computer requirement for creators (because main functionalities are done through on the web tool)
- for users of no coding-experience, provide logic organizer for complex game rules

### TODO list:
- [ ] base app: game engine part without topic: UI, menu, etc.
- [ ] design of each module (for types of various 2d games)
- [ ] testing plans
- [x] architecture design, user flow
- [ ] solution plans for concerns
- [x] hosting and launching options, plan
- [ ] hosting and launching options, implementation
- [ ] game product: resource management solution (carefully handle re-renders)
- [x] abstraction of game logic: into modularizable organizer
- [x] game mode analysis, draft
- [ ] game mode analysis, advanced
- [ ] logic organizer for game rule (this can be a module to be used), implement: between nodes & inside one game-round for specific game rules
- [ ] game-node visualization optimization
- [x] logic organizer: analysis and design
- [ ] logic organizer: preliminary implement
- [x] game data sharing and update design, architecture design
- [ ] game data sharing and update implementation
- [x] cloud db data structure design, preliminary
- [x] cloud db data structure design, optimized
- [ ] account-system design
- [ ] sample small projects (for test and demo)
- [x] consider UI language switching design
- [ ] implement and optimize UI language switching feature
- [ ] resource selector preview window/player tech exploration
- [ ] resource selector variable name paring implementation
- [ ] refactor to RESTful API in a later stage
- [ ] add warning/asking related to project/progress saving, that reminds authors to save to cloud (in balance of frequent updating)
- [ ] consideration on undo/redo/revert or log and records for authors
- [ ] dynamic tags and lists
