# ClouderOut_v1

## Plan & intro of ClouderOut: a cloud-based lightweight game engine for 2d games
- base technology: React
- idea: provide users with simple UI to create, adjust and deploy the end-result React projects (as games)
- topics: 2d games: card game, board game, fort defense/offense game, text adventure game, etc.
- creator/author being the core user of this cloud platform
- relieves the user from the local space issue and portability of devices during travel

### Features:
- account systems for creators and players
- lightweight computer requirement for creators (because main functionalities are done through on the web tool)

### TODO list:
- base app: game engine part without topic: UI, menu, etc.
- design of each module (types of 2d games)
- testing plans
