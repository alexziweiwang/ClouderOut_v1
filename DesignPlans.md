# Design Plans

## Sections designed:
1. account sign up/sign in/log out: cloud storage/database allocation for user
2. game creation and management: React-project abstraction base; design data structure for readable scripts/info-group; robust tool for game-organization content-CRUD
3. game maker: core functionality -- tool for users to create and adjust web elements for the game
4. game hoster: deploy and host the games for different players, including player data management. Effectively read through game-design info and present to players.
5. test and adjust for platforms: PC browser, iOS playing App, Android playing App
6. additional template modules: various types of game-modules for game-node options
